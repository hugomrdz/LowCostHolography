# LowCostHolography
Repository for code used in article "Low-cost holography for structured light"

## Abstract
In recent time, an increasing amount of interest has been given to the study of structured light fields which include their generation and characterization techniques, as well as their applications. Crucially, most of these techniques rely on the use of expensive devices such as liquid crystal spatial light modulators or digital micromirror devices, which also require specialized knowledge and software for their use. In this work, we present a scheme to produce low-cost amplitude holograms for the generation of structured light fields. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by creating a variety of paraxial modes, such as the well-known Laguerre- and Hermite-Gaussian beams. We also demonstrate the potential of our technique to solve the phase retrieval problem to generate 2D and 3D holographic images of objects. Finally, we compare our proposal with the typical generation techniques using a digital micromirror device. Our technique will pave the path to the generation of structured light beams in more affordable ways for their use in undergrad laboratories.

## Experimental Design
The measurements recorded to generate the results of this research were done in the Optics Laboratory of the Photonics and Mathematical Optics Group at Tec de Monterrey under supervision of Benjamín Perez García PhD. In this repository you will find the code required to generate the holograms for the Digital Micromirror Device and the postprocessing scripts used to generate the figures and analysis.
